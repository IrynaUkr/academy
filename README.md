# Academy application

## Security
OAuth2 implementation for the Academy application using Spring Boot 3.3+.
This project demonstrates OAuth2 setup with an authorization server, resource server, and client applications.
The goal is to implement OAuth2 for a single sign-on system, with JWT to carry user claims securely between services.

OAuth 2.0 is a standard that apps use to provide client apps with access.
If you would like to grant access to your app data in a secure way, then you want to use the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

The OAuth 2.0 spec has four important roles:

- Client: The app that wants to access some data.
- Resource server: The API or app that stores the data the client wants to access.
- Resource owner: The owner of the data on the resource server. For example, you're the owner of your Facebook profile.
- Authorization server: The server that manages access and issues access tokens.
